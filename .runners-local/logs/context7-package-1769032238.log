Looking at your project, I can see this is a comprehensive Ghostty terminal configuration repository with a Go-based TUI installer, Astro website for documentation, and various shell scripts for tool management.

What would you like help with today? Some common tasks I can assist with:

1. **TUI Installer** - Working on the Go/Bubbletea TUI in `tui/`
2. **Ghostty Configuration** - Modifying configs in `configs/ghostty/`
3. **Website/Documentation** - The Astro site in `astro-website/`
4. **Tool Scripts** - Install/update scripts in `scripts/`
5. **CI/CD** - Local workflow runners in `.runners-local/`

Or if you have a specific task or question, let me know.
