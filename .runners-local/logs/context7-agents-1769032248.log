Hello! How can I help you with the Ghostty Configuration Files project today?

I can assist with:
- **Configuration changes** - Ghostty settings, theme switching, performance tuning
- **TUI Installer** - The Go-based Bubbletea installer for tools and Nerd Fonts
- **CI/CD operations** - Local workflow validation, GitHub Pages deployment
- **Tool management** - Installing/updating fastfetch, gum, glow, vhs, etc.
- **Troubleshooting** - Debug issues with the setup or configuration

What would you like to work on?
