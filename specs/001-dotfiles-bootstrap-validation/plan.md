# Implementation Plan: Dotfiles Bootstrap Validation

**Branch**: `001-dotfiles-bootstrap-validation` | **Date**: 2026-05-01 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-dotfiles-bootstrap-validation/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit-plan` command. See `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Add a manifest-backed validation and setup CLI for this dotfiles repository. The
CLI will expose canonical commands `doctor`, `plan`, `apply`, and
`init-project`, use human-readable output by default, and provide stable JSON
reports for tests and automation. Implementation uses a standard-library Python
package at repository root, with `uv` used for all Python command execution and
coverage measurement. The plan includes a root manifest, safe protected-file
handling, backup-before-replace apply semantics, project agent-doc
initialization, a unittest suite using temporary directories, and a GitHub
Actions workflow that generates `coverage.xml` before optional Codacy upload.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+
**Primary Dependencies**: Python standard library only for runtime; `coverage` only for measurement in CI/local coverage commands
**Storage**: Repository files, target home/project files, timestamped backup files, and JSON reports; no database
**Testing**: `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests`; coverage via `uv run --with coverage coverage ...`
**Target Platform**: Linux-like developer machines and GitHub Actions runners
**Project Type**: Single repository CLI/tooling package
**Performance Goals**: Complete `doctor` or `plan` for the current manifest in under 2 seconds on a typical developer machine; avoid unnecessary rewrites of current files
**Constraints**: No runtime third-party dependencies; no lock file unless runtime dependencies are introduced later; never touch the real user home in tests; protected targets are manual by default; apply writes require explicit `--yes`; partial apply stops on the first failed write
**Scale/Scope**: One machine profile and one project initialization workflow in the first increment; manifest entries cover the current repo templates and protected/manual files

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Template Source of Truth**: PASS. `.template` files remain copy-and-customize sources; root and project agent symlink conventions are validated and preserved.
- **Secret-Free and Identity-Safe**: PASS. Secret scanning is a required validation surface; protected identity targets remain manual by default.
- **Protected Files**: PASS. `git/config`, `fish/fish_plugins`, `.gitignore`, and symlinked agent templates are protected/manual by default and require exact manifest entry ID opt-in.
- **Reproducible Bootstrap**: PASS. Setup is manifest-driven, dry-run capable through `doctor` and `plan`, idempotent, and backs up differing targets before writes.
- **Validation Before Coverage**: PASS. Runtime validation code and tests are planned before `coverage.xml` generation and optional Codacy upload.
- **uv Python Workflow**: PASS. Python test and coverage commands use `uv`; runtime code uses the standard library.

**Structure Decision**: Use a root Python package runnable as
`python -m dotfiles_tools` without packaging metadata. This keeps runtime
dependency management simple, allows `uv run python -m dotfiles_tools ...`, and
avoids lock files until a real runtime dependency exists.

## Phase 0: Research

Research decisions are captured in [research.md](./research.md). All planning
unknowns are resolved:

- Runtime dependency policy: standard library only.
- CLI/report format: human-readable by default with stable JSON via `--json`.
- Manifest format: root `dotfiles-manifest.json` with stable entry IDs.
- Apply failure semantics: stop on first failed write and report partial apply.
- Coverage execution: `uv run --with coverage coverage ...`, no runtime lock file.

## Phase 1: Design

Design artifacts:

- [data-model.md](./data-model.md): manifest entries, target state, operation plan, backup record, project variables, validation report.
- [contracts/cli.md](./contracts/cli.md): command arguments, exit status, and JSON report contract for `doctor`, `plan`, `apply`, and `init-project`.
- [contracts/manifest.schema.json](./contracts/manifest.schema.json): manifest structure contract.
- [quickstart.md](./quickstart.md): local validation, dry-run, temp-home apply, project-init, coverage, and CI expectations.

## Constitution Check - Post-Design

- **Template Source of Truth**: PASS. Data model and CLI contracts preserve template behavior and symlink checks.
- **Secret-Free and Identity-Safe**: PASS. Secret scanning is represented in the data model, CLI reports, and quickstart validation flow.
- **Protected Files**: PASS. Manifest schema requires IDs and supports protected/manual entries; CLI contract requires exact ID opt-in.
- **Reproducible Bootstrap**: PASS. `doctor`, `plan`, `apply`, backups, partial apply, and idempotence are covered by contracts and quickstart scenarios.
- **Validation Before Coverage**: PASS. Quickstart and plan require tests before coverage upload; CI uploads only when token exists.
- **uv Python Workflow**: PASS. All Python commands in quickstart use `uv`.
